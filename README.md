# Hello, and welcome to my GithubðŸ‘‹
### My name is Josephine Ewoma, and I'm currently working toward becoming a full stack developer ðŸ’»

> **A bit about me**
> 
> I have a background in marine biology and biodiversity conservation, but am keen to make a career shift into the world of tech. I hope that the knowledge and skills I've previously gained can be combined with the web development skills I'm learning. I'm currently enrolled on the HyperionDev 'Web Development Fundamentals' course.
